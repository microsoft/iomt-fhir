# IoMT Connector Data Mapper
 
The IoMT Connector Data Mapper has been discontinued in favor of the [MedTech mapping debugger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/how-to-use-mapping-debugger) in Azure.  Please use that tool or refer to an [earlier release](https://github.com/microsoft/iomt-fhir/blob/2.0.1/tools/data-mapper/README.md) of the IoMT Connector where the IoMT Connector Data Mapper was supported.
